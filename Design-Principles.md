# Overview

The following applies to the development of Trace. These should provide guidance to the ethos behind the platform. 

- Where possible, the full equation is to be written out, except where:
  - Empirical relationships exist / lookup tables are required; or
  - the full equation is difficult to read as an inline function.
- Units (eg 10 m<sup>2</sup>,Q=2) are presented as custom formatting with the cell.
- All losses are to be shown as negative numbers.
- Blank Calculation Sheets and Standard Calculation Sheets are to be printable with a layout suitable for fitting to standard paper sizes.
- All sheets are to have a standard header block layout.
- User input elements are to be clearly denoted by the Trace Input Style.

- Title

- Mitigated
- Source
