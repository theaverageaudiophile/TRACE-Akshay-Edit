# Noise Functions Module
This module is at the heart of Trace, and does the most heavy lifting, computationally. It is expected that this section of Trace will have to most development as more functions are requested from acoustic engineers and implemented as needs arise.

## Air Absorption

## Distance Attenuation
`10*log(Q/4*PI*(R^2))`
